# 4.3 Security

## 4.3.1 Conduct Cyber Security Risk Assessment

### Overview
As part of our project, we conducted a mini cyber security risk assessment focusing on a subset of steps typically included in a full risk assessment. This was due to the limited time and information available to us. The assessment evaluated vulnerabilities across various information security threats and analyzed multiple types of data assets.

### Methodology
Our approach involved assessing the network against at least 8 of the 12 identified information security threats, incorporating a range of asset types, and considering at least 4 different data assets to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of potential risks.

### TVA Matrix
We have documented our findings in a Threat-Vulnerability-Asset (TVA) Matrix, which details the relationship between assets, their vulnerabilities, potential threats, and the corresponding risk levels and recommended controls.

### Key Vulnerabilities Identified
1. **Data Breaches**: High risk due to potential unauthorized access to the customer database facilitated by weak authentication methods.
2. **Service Disruptions**: DDoS attacks present a high risk to our network devices due to inadequate firewall protections.
3. **Data Leakage**: Medium risk from SQL Injection due to insecure SQL queries affecting our customer database.
4. **Insider Threats**: High risk associated with insufficient awareness training for employees, increasing susceptibility to phishing attacks.

## 4.3.2 Recommend Security Controls

### High-Risk Data Asset
From our risk assessment, the customer database was identified as the data asset with the highest risk, primarily due to threats of unauthorized access and SQL injection.

### Recommended Security Controls
- **Encryption**:
  - **Purpose**: To protect data integrity and confidentiality.
  - **Implementation**: Implement AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit.
  - **Network Design Consideration**: Specifically apply encryption to database and backup connections.
  - **Disadvantages**: May introduce performance overhead, potentially slowing down data retrieval times.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
  - **Purpose**: To enhance access security for systems handling sensitive data.
  - **Implementation**: Deploy an MFA system that integrates with existing user directory services.
  - **Network Design Consideration**: Apply MFA for all administrative access to servers and databases.
  - **Disadvantages**: Adds an additional step in the authentication process, which may initially inconvenience users.

- **Firewalls**:
  - **Purpose**: To monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, preventing unauthorized access and attacks.
  - **Implementation**: Configure application-aware firewalls to restrict traffic specifically to and from the customer database.
  - **Network Design Consideration**: Install firewalls at strategic network junctions to effectively segment and protect network traffic.
  - **Disadvantages**: Incorrect configuration can lead to legitimate access being blocked, potentially impacting user experience.

### Conclusion
The implementation of these controls will significantly reduce the risk levels identified in our risk assessment. By addressing the vulnerabilities with appropriate security measures, we can enhance the overall security posture of our network, ensuring robust protection against identified threats.
