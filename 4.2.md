# 4.2 Cloud Services Analysis

## 4.2.1 Cloud Server Evaluation

### Overview
Given the franchise's limited ICT resources and concerns about the reliability of centralized servers, we have evaluated the potential transition of our web servers to the cloud. This section details the cost, configuration, and suitability analysis of hosting the franchise's web server on Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud.

### Cost and Configuration Comparison

The evaluation focuses on servers hosted in Australia, using similar configurations across Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud to ensure an accurate cost comparison.

#### Comparative Cost Table
Here is a detailed comparison of the estimated monthly and annual costs associated with each cloud provider:

| Provider     | Description | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost  |  Data Region     |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Azure**    | 8 Core VM with 14 GB RAM, plus 1 TB Block Blob Storage | $681.76 | $8,181.12  | Australia East / East US |
| **AWS**      | EC2 instance, VPN Connection, Public IPv4 Address | $948.98 | $11,387.76  | Asia Pacific (Sydney) |
| **Google Cloud** | Custom Core and RAM, Storage, External IP Charge | $848.99 | $10,187.88  | Melbourne            |

For detailed cost breakdowns, see the following documents:

- [AWS Cost Estimate](./AWS.csv)
- [Google Cloud Cost Estimate](./gcp.csv)


### Evaluation and Recommendation
Based on the detailed cost analysis, Azure presents a cost-effective option for hosting with robust features suitable for the franchise's operations. While AWS offers extensive scalability, its cost is higher. Google Cloud provides a middle ground in pricing but may require additional configurations to meet specific business needs.

## 4.2.2 Backup Solutions

### Current Backup Infrastructure
The franchise currently relies on a local RAID NAS for backing up critical data, which includes sales records, financial data, and customer information. This section evaluates the adequacy of this setup and explores potential improvements.

#### Evaluation of Current Setup
- **Adequacy**: The current RAID NAS setup provides essential redundancy but may fall short in disaster recovery capabilities.
- **Risk Assessment**: Local backups pose risks such as physical damage or data loss in catastrophic events.

### Cloud and Non-Cloud Backup Options
Exploration of cloud and non-cloud backup solutions to enhance data security and accessibility.

#### Cloud Backup Services
- **Azure**: Offers integrated backup solutions with georedundancy to ensure data availability and security.
- **AWS**: Provides extensive options for backup across multiple regions, ensuring business continuity.
- **Google Cloud**: Features robust data storage solutions with automatic scaling and data redundancy.

#### Recommendation
Given the critical nature of the data, a hybrid approach combining local NAS with cloud backups would enhance data security and availability, leveraging cloud redundancy and local storage robustness.

### Backup Strategy for CQU ICT Students
For CQU ICT students, it is recommended to utilize cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive for backing up academic work. These services offer:

- **Ease of Use**: User-friendly interfaces suitable for students.
- **Version Control**: Ability to restore previous versions of documents.
- **Accessibility**: Access files from anywhere, on any device.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Free or low-cost plans that meet student needs.

## Conclusion
The shift to cloud services offers significant benefits in terms of scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. For the franchise, Azure provides the most cost-effective and feature-rich environment suitable for our web hosting and backup needs. This strategic move is supported by a comprehensive evaluation of service offerings, pricing, and operational compatibility with our business requirements.
