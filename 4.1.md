## Network Diagram Description
**Diagram Overview:**
This diagram illustrates a robust network setup optimized for security and efficiency, tailored for a gym franchise's varied IT needs across different operational areas.

## Key Design Decisions
- **Segmentation and Centralized Management**: This design principle ensures that each segment of the network—corporate, gym, and retail—is isolated to enhance security and performance. Centralized management facilitates easier updates and uniform policy enforcement.
- **High-Performance Hardware**: Essential to handle the high volume of data and connectivity requirements of the franchise, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted service.

## WiFi Design
- **Security and Bandwidth Management**: Implements WPA3, the latest security standard for WiFi, providing strong encryption and security. Distinct SSIDs for each operational area optimize bandwidth usage and maintain network performance under diverse usage scenarios.

## IP Addressing Schema
The network is meticulously structured with designated IP ranges to streamline network management and minimize conflicts:
- **Corporate Office**: `10.0.0.0/24`
- **Premium Gym Outlet**: `10.0.1.0/24`
- **Retail Health Shop**: `10.0.2.0/24`

## Hardware Recommendations
