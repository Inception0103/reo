# Project Summary and Collaboration Reflection

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive summary of our project's various aspects, covering cloud services evaluation, security measures, ethical considerations, and our group's collaborative efforts in managing the project.

## 4.1 Network Design and Implementation
We designed and implemented a robust network tailored to the needs of a growing franchise. Key aspects included:
- **Scalable Network Architecture**: Ensured the network could expand in response to increasing demand.
- **Security Protocols**: Implemented advanced security measures such as firewalls and encryption to protect data integrity and privacy.

## 4.2 Cloud Services Analysis
### 4.2.1 Cloud Server Evaluation
We evaluated potential cloud services for hosting the franchise's web server, focusing on Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. Cost, configuration, and regional considerations were analyzed in depth.

#### Cost and Configuration Comparison
| Provider     | Description | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost  |  Data Region     |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Azure**    | 8 Core VM with 14 GB RAM, plus 1 TB Block Blob Storage | $681.76 | $8,181.12  | Australia East / East US |
| **AWS**      | EC2 instance, VPN Connection, Public IPv4 Address | $948.98 | $11,387.76  | Asia Pacific (Sydney) |
| **Google Cloud** | Custom Core and RAM, Storage, External IP Charge | $848.99 | $10,187.88  | Melbourne            |

### 4.2.2 Backup Solutions
We recommended hybrid backup solutions combining local and cloud storage to enhance data security and availability.

## 4.3 Security
### 4.3.1 Cyber Security Risk Assessment
A targeted cyber security risk assessment was conducted to identify and mitigate potential threats across multiple layers of our network.

### 4.3.2 Security Controls
We recommended implementing encryption, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and firewalls, particularly focusing on protecting high-risk data assets.

## 4.4 Ethical Issues
### 4.4.1 Data Collection
We discussed ethical concerns regarding the collection and use of member-client information, emphasizing the need for transparency and minimal data collection that respects privacy.

### 4.4.2 Security Cameras
The use of security cameras raised ethical questions about privacy and surveillance. We explored the balance between security and privacy, adhering to local regulations.

## Group Collaboration and Task Management Reflection
### Group Dynamics
Our team consisted of two members, and we divided tasks based on our individual expertise to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.

### Task Distribution
- **Sandesh Thapa** focused on research and documentation, ensuring all written content met project standards.
- **ArkoSathi** handled technical analysis and data evaluation, providing detailed insights for the project.

### Effective Strategies
- **Regular Communication**: Our team maintained continuous communication through various channels to ensure alignment and timely updates.
- **Peer Reviews**: We regularly reviewed each other's contributions to maintain a high standard of quality and consistency.

### Challenges Encountered
- **Workload Management**: Balancing the workload between two members occasionally presented challenges, particularly when integrating complex components.

### Recommendations for Future Projects
- **Structured Task Scheduling**: Implementing a more structured schedule could help in managing tasks more efficiently.
- **Enhanced Tool Utilization**: Greater use of collaborative tools could streamline workflows and improve document management.

## Conclusion
The project provided valuable insights into network design, cloud services, security, and ethics in IT projects. Our collaborative efforts highlighted the importance of effective teamwork and continuous learning.
